# quoteProject
Quote of the day program with an alien terminal look.
The program reads through a text file, randomly selects a quote, and types it out into the window.
### Future Plans
- [ ] Add a glowy effect to the box and text
- [ ] Implement a time interval on which quotes will change
- [ ] Add more quotes
### Typing Away
